## Tasks

- Prepare a view displaying a table of elements (columns Number, Name, Weight, Symbol).
- Simulate downloading data to the table during application startup.
- Add the ability to edit any value of the record displayed in the table (popup input to change the value).
- After confirming the change, the table row should update.
- Editing should take place without mutating the data.
- Add a filter that will allow filtering the results (one input filtering all fields). 
- Filtering should take place after 2s without changing the value in the input.
